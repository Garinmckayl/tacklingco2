# Algae-based carbon sequestration
This project is built for [Hack the Planet Challenge](https://www.therelicans.com/therelicans/combat-climate-change-and-earn-prizes-with-hack-the-planet-4g5) for NewRelic.
My hope for this project is to help researchers and scientists combat global warming by utilizing Algae based cost effective carbon sequestration.
